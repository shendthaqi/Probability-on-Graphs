\section{Gromov-Milman theorem}


$X$ is said to satisfiy a Poincare inequality if its probability measure $\PP=:\mu$ does so.


\begin{thm} [Gromov-Milman]
    Let $X$ be a random variable satisfying a Poincare inequality with some $\kappa >0$. Then, there is some $C<\infty$ such that for all $f \in \LLL^2$ with $\abs{\nabla f(x)}^2\leq 1$ and any $\lambda>0$
    $$\PP(\abs{f(X)-\EE[f(X)]}>\lambda)\leq C e^{-\sqrt{\kappa}\lambda}$$
\end{thm}
