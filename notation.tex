\section*{Notation}

For the sake of readability, we will use some notation that could be regarded as ambiguous, but will be clear in this context. We will try to be uniform and usually note $\PP(Z\geq \lambda) \leq f(\lambda)$ and try to use $\lambda$. When we have (independent) random variables $\XN$, we will write $S_N=\sumn X_n$ as well as $S_N^a=\sumn a_nX_n$.
